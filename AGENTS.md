# meta-signal-cloud — Agent Instructions

This repository is a pure meta Signal contract crate. It declares
meta cloud-provider authority and policy records. It contains no
daemon, storage, actors, provider clients, or secret bytes.

Secret material crosses this contract only as durable secret handles.
Do not add fields that carry provider tokens, passwords, or private keys.
